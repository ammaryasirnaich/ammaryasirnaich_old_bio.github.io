I came from a Computer Engineering background and i doing my PhD in computer science PhD degree at QMUL  specializing in Computer Vision with a keen interest in using machine learning for 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles. My research focuses on applying deep learning techniques inlcuding CNNs and (Visual Language Model)VLM to 3D Object Detection task using publicily available dataset such as KiTTI and Waymo. 
I have also be researching on the effects of adverse weather condition on lidar sensor which producing noise in point cloud data.


I am also interetst in working on other vision task such as depth estimation and object tracking.

Part of his role at university was being a Teaching Assistant for the 



<!-- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at the TU Berlin.

🔬 My research interests are in bridging vision and language modalities and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience


## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/ammaryasirnaich) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content. -->
